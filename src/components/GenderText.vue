      I am non-binary, and use the singular 'they' as my personal pronoun.
    </p>
    <p>
      You probably have questions. I'm still a little uncomfortable discussing it all outside queer circles,
      so let me give you a primer, and you can ask me about anything I don't address.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">Non-what?</p>
    <p>
      Non-binary. The gender binary - that is, male and female - is increasingly seen as outdated and
      restrictive for no good reason. Non-binary people have been around for all of human history, but it's
      only fairly recently that we're starting to be formally defined in terms of sociological theory.
    </p>
    <p>
      Being non-binary or otherwise genderqueer is more complicated than 'somewhere between male and
      female'. Gender is distinct from sex, and refers to a fairly nebulous psychological, cultural, and
      sociological identity. As a society, we normalise gender closely tracking sex, but it's not that
      simple and never has been.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, to us, gender isn't a simple line between male and female. There are other axes to it, ones
      which don't have convenient names yet. Our gender identity shifts around in this multidimensional
      space, where gender is a strange, variable, often inscrutable haze.
    </p>
    <p>
      We use the identifier because we rarely, if ever, feel fully <em>anything</em> in that space. Our
      perception of gender moves around so much that we don't see any meaningful value in tracking it for
      the benefit of others, which would be practically infeasible anyway. Instead, we provide the best
      long-term definition we can, and write pieces like this to try to explain.
    </p>
    <p>
      For brevity, people like me often use the contraction 'enby' (singular) or 'enbies' (plural) to refer
      to ourselves - the spoken form of "NB" for "Non Binary".
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">I thought you were cis?</p>
    <p>So did I.</p>
    <p>
      First, a definition - cisgender, or 'cis', people have an assigned gender at birth matching their
      actual gender. It's the opposite of transgender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding my personal experience, for a very long time, I fully believed that I
      <em>was</em> cisgender. A couple of years ago, a trans developer posted something on Twitter which
      made me stop and think.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you feel a thing so regularly, you just assume that it's part of the normal human experience.
      Frequently having times you wish you could interact with the world being seen as feminine, envying
      people who get feminine presentation for free? Turns out those are things which cis people don't
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was particularly confusing because - and this is why I never pursued it - it wasn't the case all
      the time. I've always felt 'somewhere in the middle' and pursued androgyny. While I had the occasional
      wish to present femme, I rarely (if ever) had the wish to present more masculine. I put this down to
      being able to inherently pass as male - masc presentation required no effort.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">So are non-binary people transgender?</p>
    <p>I do consider myself transgender, but with hesitation and awareness of privilege.</p>
    <p>
      That depends who you ask. Some feel the label to be appropriate, some don't. In terms of dictionary
      definitions, yes - the gender we were assigned at birth does not match our actual gender, and never
      has. There's a complication to it, which is that the construction of the word 'transgender' implies
      alternation from one binary to another, and so some people aren't comfortable with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      There's also the factor with which I have trouble, which is that it feels like appropriating someone
      else's struggle. Non-binary people do experience dysphoria and have trouble passing, but it's
      different from someone who is binary transgender. If you're crossing the entire length of the
      male-female axis, while your dysphoria and passing problems are restricted to that single axis, they
      can be as severe as is possible on that axis.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">But there are only two genders, male and female.</p>
    <p>
      I think it's very likely that you're conflating sex and gender here. Sex is determined by your genes,
      and relates to the biological differentiation of your body. Gender is distinct, and refers to a fairly
      nebulous psychological, cultural, and sociological identity. As a society, we normalise gender closely
      tracking sex, but it's not that simple and has never been that simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      But sex isn't binary either. Most of us are aware of sexual differentiation resolving somewhere other
      than the extremes of 'male' and 'female', referred to as being intersex or (to use an outdated,
      inappropriate, now-offensive term) hermaphroditic, and the perception we have is that it's rare.
    </p>
    <p>
      Studies suggest that while sex differentiation exists on a single axis, it's actually quite common for
      a person to be somewhere between the extremes.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">'They' is plural, not singular!</p>
    <p>
      You're not the first person to have that response, and you are objectively wrong. Consider the
      following sentences, which while admittedly somewhat contrived, scan naturally -
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>When I tell somebody a joke, <strong>they</strong> laugh.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>When I greet a friend, I hug <strong>them</strong>.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>When somebody does not get a haircut, <strong>their</strong> hair grows long.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>If my mobile phone runs out of power, a friend lets me borrow <strong>theirs</strong>.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <blockquote>
      <p>
        <em>Each child dresses <strong>themself</strong>.</em>
      </p>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
      The fact is that you use the singular <strong>they</strong> every day. You just don't think about it,
      and that's why it feels artificial.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl text-orange-500 italic">But the icon you used is inherently binary!</p>
    <p>
      I know. If you come up with a better option to represent gender identity which works as a monochrome
      icon, do enbies and genderqueer people in general a favour and
